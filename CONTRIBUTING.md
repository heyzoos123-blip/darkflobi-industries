## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow the existing terminal aesthetic

### Interactive Features

### Adding New Workers
To add a new AI worker:

1. Add worker to the `workers` object in `index.html`
2. Create unique personality and responses
3. Update the worker directory table
4. Add relevant commands for the worker
5. Test interactive conversations

Example worker structure:
```javascript
new_worker_id: {
    name: "WorkerName-ID",
    responses: [
        "First response showing expertise",
        "Second response with personality", 
        "Third response with current task",
        "Fourth response showing results"
    ]
}
```

### Adding New Features
